# Synthetic Image in Octave
This repository covers computer graphic algorithms which were written in Octave language, including:

1. Draw line: (naive algorithm, middle point algorithm, Bresenham algorithm)

2. Draw circle (naive algorithm, middle point algorithm, Bresenham algorithm)

3. Draw polygon 

4. Fill algorithm (scanline algorithm)
